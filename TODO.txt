- clangd is just so badly broken...
- implement tilp build from source
- obviously finish the menu system
- add an imagestudio devshell or roll our own
    (will need wine, some pixel art editor (mspaint is ok [needs mfcu42dll (winetricks -q mfcu42)])
    and need to write a derivation for imagestudio)
    image studio is available on ticalc https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/307/30736.html
    in all honesty i think we can roll image studio on our own. they have RLE routines too

    would be helpful for making borders
- animation on textboxes
    idea for this is that we draw the growing box on one plane so it almost looks "transparent"
    then once the box is fully drawn we can work w both planes or whatever.
    by "growing" i just mean like, from the center growing out, or maybe a wipe or something.
    perhaps you can have ANIM_WIPE_R, ANIM_WIPE_L, ANIM_GROW_C? (or we could do function ptrs to the anims?)
- greyscale wrappers for text and whatnot
- add doxygen to CMakeLists.txt
- add "sphinx" for nicer documentation files
- static assert would be very very nice ....
- sound engine? maybe some crude waveforms, tiemu has sound support.
     i'd like to benchmark how costly it is, and for game code would require interleaving jumps to the audio routine
     or perhaps interrupt timing.
     i believe AutoInt1 can be used for this purpose by redirecting GetGrayInt1Handler. would have to make
     changes to the menu code, but AutoInt1 is quite fast (how fast?), much faster than AI5/PRG.
