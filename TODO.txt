- clangd is just so badly broken...
- implement tilp build from source
- obviously finish the menu system
- add an imagestudio devshell or roll our own
    (will need wine, some pixel art editor (mspaint is ok [needs mfcu42dll (winetricks -q mfcu42)])
    and need to write a derivation for imagestudio)
    image studio is available on ticalc https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/307/30736.html
    in all honesty i think we can roll image studio on our own. they have RLE routines too
- animation on textboxes
- clang format
- greyscale wrappers for text and whatnot
