- implement tilp build from source
- animation on textboxes
    idea for this is that we draw the growing box on one plane so it almost looks "transparent"
    then once the box is fully drawn we can work w both planes or whatever.
    by "growing" i just mean like, from the center growing out, or maybe a wipe or something.
    perhaps you can have ANIM_WIPE_R, ANIM_WIPE_L, ANIM_GROW_C? (or we could do function ptrs to the anims?)
- add doxygen to CMakeLists.txt
- add "sphinx" for nicer documentation files
- static assert would be very very nice ....
- sound engine? maybe some crude waveforms, tiemu has sound support.
     i'd like to benchmark how costly it is, and for game code would require interleaving jumps to the audio routine
     or perhaps interrupt timing.
     i believe AutoInt1 can be used for this purpose by redirecting GetGrayInt1Handler. would have to make
     changes to the menu code, but AutoInt1 is quite fast (how fast?), much faster than AI5/PRG.
