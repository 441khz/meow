libti{cables, calcs, files, usb} derivations.
These are older versions that are used to build tiemu-3.02.
I believe there are some newer ones available on nixpkgs,
but even more cutting edge ones are needed for the latest versions
of tiemu (libticonv 1.16 mini or something, not served here or by nixpkgs).
