gcc4ti is lionel debroux's somewhat maintained fork of tigcc (updates once in a blue moon as of the early 2020s)
tigcc is kevin kofler et al's version original version of tigcc (no longer maintained)

gcc4ti can build from source on <=gcc10Stdenv and emit x64 binaries. We opt for this. Internally, the binaries are still named
tigcc and what not, so they're easily intercompatible, much to the dismay of Kevin Kofler himself (see gcc4ti issues page).
That feud between kofler and debroux has lasted for over 20 years....

tigcc can build from source, but I've only managed to get it to work building against gcc49Stdenv.
That source build derivation for tigcc is not included here right now because the
flake is not pinned to an old enough version of nixpkgs which serves gcc49Stdenv.

So, tigcc is built from a binary hosted on the tigcc website. Please note that tigcc binary version is i686, not amd64!

There is a nasty "bug" where Nix strips the tigcc.a library archive, and the linker throws a fit.

If you ever see a linker error like:
    ... tigcc.a: Error: Archive has no symbol table

You really should set dontStrip = true in your derivation!

texinfo4 is here for tiemu. it needs that specific version...
